== Clang Format
Code format is verified at commit and required for PRs.
This is done by `clang-format`.
The config file (`.clang-format`) is present at the root of the project.

`clang-format` also provides `git-clang-format`, which can be used to validate the format of the current working changes.

Executing `git-clang-format` before every commit can be tiresome.
Because of this, a git pre-commit hook can be used to invoke `git-clang-format`

Sample pre-commit hook below. Ensure that:

- `BIN_DIR` contains the path to `clang-format` binary and `git-clang-format` script
- `git-clang-format` has the execution flag set

.`.git/hooks/pre-commit`

# Hook script to verify what is about to be committed is appropriately formatted.
#
# Instructions:
#  * Copy this file to $(git rev-parse --git-dir)/hooks/pre-commit.
#  * Update CLANG_FORMAT below if you wish to use a custom path.
#
# If you want something more advanced, like automatically formatting files,
# you can look at existing scripts at your own risk, of course, such as
# https://github.com/barisione/clang-format-hooks.
