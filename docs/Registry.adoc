Registry represents a bunch of properties, that are viewed as one json, but store fragmented, and in groups.

Sub-Json objects can be accessed using the "." in the key
For example, registry.getJson("t1").getJson("t2") is equivalent to registry.getJson("t1.t2");
A group property, therefore, represents a json object. "t1" is a group. "t1.t2" is a group
Only json-objects are defined as group properties.

Registry is by itself Read-Only.
To write, transactions are used to queue up more write operations in batch.
Transactions are added to a lock free queue, a separate thread will process stores.
The store process works as follows to ensure Read-Only status of registry
Two banks of data -> one active at a time.
Transactions load data from active read only bank.
When the transaction size reaches a certain limit, a processor thread is triggered.
When transactions are processed, the data is applied to the inactive bank.
When the write is finished, and the data has been written to the disk, the data banks are swapped.
To ensure read-only in any MT case, lock free, an atomic pointer is used to register the currently active bank.

Transactions works RAII style. Upon destruction, it is queued to the registry.

A transaction can pre-load its info, by giving it a set of group keys. This way, a preload of those groups into the temporary instance of the Transaction can be loaded, for modification and direct in-memory-modification.
